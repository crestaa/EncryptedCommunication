# EncryptedCommunication
Encrypted client-server communication

### *! REALLY REALLY REALLY EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT !*


For now:
- client-server handshake
- supports only one client :(
- public RSA keys exchange for encryption
- client can send to server an encrypted message and receive the same message decrypted and encrypted again by server (temporary, only for test purposes) 




TODO:
- multi-client with server only for sorting already encrypted messages :)
- full-duplex and asynchronous communication
- cleaner code and refractoring



**Netbeans IDE 8.2 or above recommended**
